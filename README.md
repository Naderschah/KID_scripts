### Satellites for Consideration:
These are compiled from the UCS summary with minor filtering applied, newer satellites are treated first

### Possible
1. Jilin-1 GaoFen 03D (04-07)
	
    Consumer Earth observation, aim at disaster relieve. Smallest spatial resolution 0.75m - GaoFen 04A Prototype was also launched wiht 0.5 m resolution check info
	
    NORAD : 49004
	
    Could not find dataproducts for above but for 01-03 I could with resolution better than 0.75m
    In wavebands:
	 Panchromatic color：450nm～700nm
	Multispectral：
		Blue：430nm～520nm
		Green：520nm～610nm
		Red 610nm～690nm
		Near-infrared：770～895nm

2. Siwei Gaojing 
    Commercial Satellite - I dont know cant find it
    But I did find other satellites from the same company the most appropriate would be SuperView1 (http://en.spacewillinfo.com/english/Satellite/SuperView_1/) it has a spatial resolution of 0.5 m in PAN (450-890nm) and 2m in MS (450-520nm, 520nm-590nm, 630-690nm,770-790nm)
    The issue is I cant figure out how to get the data as the project only finishes by the end of the year

4 NuSat - Satellogic
    Comercial Data Satellite - Couldnt figure out how to grab only this satellites data 
    High Resolution Data at 1 m resolution Super Resolution available on request with 70cm with resolution in bands:
    Blue: 450 – 510 nm
    Green: 510 – 580 nm
    Red: 590 – 690 nm
    Near-IR: 750 – 900 nm
    All of this is with Image Accuracy 10 m CE90

5 BlackSky - Bunch of Satellites, offer currently only early access to data products, advertise 0.3-1 m spatial resolution in the optical bands, which is unknown 

6 EnMAP - Collects a lot of small wavebands (hyperspectral) but at 30x30m resolution

7 There are a lot of military satellites from the  People's Liberation Army's Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) however no info is available for those, if we can access them it might be very useful

8  Pléiades Neo - Sun-synchronous orbit, - Only daytime  

### Not Possible:
1. Cosmos 2555  : Small Military Optical Reconnaissance - Russian 
	Status : Classified
	NORAD : 52330

2. USA 327 :
    Status : Classified
    NORAD : 52259
